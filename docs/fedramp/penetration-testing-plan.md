## 3. Testing Methodology

### 3.1 Testing Approach
**Primary Methodology**: Gray-box Testing

**Secondary Methodologies**:
- **Black-box Testing**: For external attack surface validation
- **White-box Testing**: For code review and internal logic validation

### 3.2 Testing Phases

#### Phase 1: Reconnaissance and Intelligence Gathering (2 days)

- DNS enumeration and subdomain discovery
- SSL/TLS certificate analysis
- Public information gathering
- Technology stack identification

#### Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment (3 days)
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Manual vulnerability validation
- Configuration assessment
- Compliance gap analysis
- Network mapping and service enumeration

#### Phase 3: Exploitation and Privilege Escalation (5 days)
- Manual penetration testing
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Authorization escalation testing
- Data access boundary testing
- Multi-tenant isolation validation
- Cross-tenant data leakage testing

#### Phase 4: Post-Exploitation and Persistence (2 days)
- Lateral movement testing
- Data exfiltration simulation
- Persistence mechanism testing
- Detection evasion techniques
- Administrative access validation

#### Phase 5: Reporting and Remediation Validation (3 days)
- Comprehensive report generation
- Risk rating and prioritization
- Remediation recommendation development
- Executive summary preparation
- Re-testing of critical findings

### 3.3 Testing Tools and Techniques

#### Automated Tools:
- **Nessus/Qualys**: Vulnerability scanning
- **Burp Suite Professional**: Web application testing
- **OWASP ZAP**: Security scanning and testing

- **Multi-tenant architecture security testing**

## 4. Rules of Engagement

### 4.1 Testing Environment
- **Primary Environment**: Dedicated FedRAMP testing environment
- **Backup Environment**: Staging environment (if production testing is required)
- **Prohibited**: Direct testing against production environment
- **Data**: Synthetic test data only - no production or real customer data

### 4.2 Testing Windows
- **Primary Window**: Monday-Friday, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM EST
- **Extended Window**: Monday-Friday, 6:00 AM - 8:00 PM EST (with approval)

- **Blackout Periods**: Federal holidays and maintenance windows

### 4.3 Communication Protocols
- **Primary Contact**: Security Team Lead
- **Secondary Contact**: DevOps Manager
- **Emergency Contact**: CISO (24/7 availability)
- **Escalation**: CTO within 4 hours for critical findings
- **Status Updates**: Daily status calls during testing period

### 4.4 Testing Constraints

#### Allowed Activities:
- Non-destructive testing of all in-scope systems
- Account enumeration with test accounts only
- Brute force attacks against test accounts (rate-limited)
- Social engineering simulation (with prior approval)
- Physical security assessment of accessible areas

#### Prohibited Activities:
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Data destruction or modification
- Access to production customer data
- Testing against out-of-scope systems
- Unauthorized privilege escalation beyond test boundaries
- Sharing of findings with unauthorized personnel

### 4.5 Data Handling Requirements
- All testing data must be synthetic and non-sensitive
- Test results must be encrypted at rest and in transit
