## 9. Troubleshooting and Common Issues

### 9.1 Common Integration Issues

#### 9.1.1 Cloud Provider Authentication Issues
**Symptom:** Unable to connect to Azure/AWS/GCP services
**Common Causes:**
- Expired or invalid service principal credentials
- Insufficient permissions for integration account
- Network connectivity or firewall blocking
- Incorrect endpoint or region configuration
- Certificate validation failures

**Resolution Steps:**
```bash
# Azure Troubleshooting
# Verify service principal credentials
az ad sp show --id <service-principal-id>
az role assignment list --assignee <service-principal-id>

# Test API connectivity
az account show
az resource list --resource-group <resource-group-name>

# AWS Troubleshooting
# Verify IAM credentials and permissions
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name CATOIntegrationRole

# Test API connectivity
aws config describe-configuration-recorders
aws security-hub get-findings --max-results 10
```

#### 9.1.2 Data Synchronization Issues
**Symptom:** Data not appearing or outdated information displayed
**Common Causes:**
- API rate limiting or throttling
- Large dataset processing delays
- Network latency or intermittent connectivity
- Data format or schema mismatches
- Authentication token expiration

**Resolution Steps:**
1. **Check Integration Status:** Verify all cloud provider connections are active
2. **Review Sync Logs:** Examine synchronization logs for errors or warnings
3. **Validate Permissions:** Ensure service accounts have necessary read permissions
4. **Test Manual Sync:** Trigger manual synchronization to isolate issues
5. **Monitor Performance:** Check for rate limiting or performance bottlenecks

### 9.2 User Access and Authentication Issues

#### 9.2.1 Single Sign-On (SSO) Problems
**Symptom:** Users unable to authenticate via SAML/ADFS
**Common Causes:**
- SAML assertion configuration errors
- Certificate expiration or validation issues
- Identity provider connectivity problems
- User attribute mapping misconfigurations
- Session timeout or security policy conflicts

**Resolution Steps:**
```xml
<!-- Verify SAML Configuration -->
<saml2:Assertion>
  <saml2:Issuer>https://agency.gov/adfs/services/trust</saml2:Issuer>
  <saml2:Subject>
    <saml2:NameID Format="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent">
      user@agency.gov
    </saml2:NameID>
  </saml2:Subject>
  <saml2:AttributeStatement>
    <saml2:Attribute Name="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role">
      <saml2:AttributeValue>CATOUser</saml2:AttributeValue>
    </saml2:Attribute>
  </saml2:AttributeStatement>
</saml2:Assertion>
```

**Troubleshooting Checklist:**
- [ ] SAML metadata configuration validated
- [ ] Certificate validity confirmed (not expired)
- [ ] User exists in identity provider directory
- [ ] Role mapping configuration verified
- [ ] Network connectivity to IdP confirmed
- [ ] Browser cookies and cache cleared

#### 9.2.2 Multi-Factor Authentication Issues
**Symptom:** MFA prompts failing or not appearing
**Common Causes:**
- Mobile device synchronization issues
- SMS delivery problems or delays
- Hardware token battery or connectivity issues
- User enrollment status problems
- Policy configuration conflicts

**Resolution Process:**
1. **Verify User Enrollment:** Confirm user is properly enrolled in MFA
2. **Check Device Status:** Validate mobile app or hardware token functionality
3. **Test Alternative Methods:** Try backup authentication methods
4. **Review Policies:** Examine MFA policies and exemptions
5. **Escalate if Needed:** Engage Tier 2 support for complex issues

### 9.3 Performance and Scalability Issues

#### 9.3.1 Slow Report Generation
**Symptom:** Reports taking excessive time to generate or timing out
**Common Causes:**
- Large datasets without proper indexing
- Complex queries with inefficient joins
- Insufficient database resources or connections
- Network bandwidth limitations
- Concurrent report generation overload

**Optimization Strategies:**
```sql
-- Database Query Optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_compliance_data_date 
ON compliance_assessments (assessment_date, system_id);

-- Implement data partitioning
ALTER TABLE audit_logs 
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(created_date));

-- Use materialized views for complex aggregations
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW compliance_summary AS
SELECT system_id, control_family, 
       COUNT(*) as total_controls,
       SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'Implemented' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as implemented
FROM security_controls 
GROUP BY system_id, control_family;
```

#### 9.3.2 High System Resource Usage
**Symptom:** Platform response times degraded during peak usage
**Common Causes:**
- Insufficient compute resources allocated
- Memory leaks in application components
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Inefficient caching strategies
- Concurrent user limits exceeded

**Scaling Solutions:**
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Add additional application instances
- **Vertical Scaling:** Increase CPU and memory resources
- **Database Optimization:** Implement read replicas and connection pooling
- **Caching Implementation:** Deploy Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute user traffic across multiple instances
