# Terraform Configuration Standards
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 3.50"
    }
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
  
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "terraform-state-rg"
    storage_account_name = "terraformstate"
    container_name      = "tfstate"
    key                 = "environment.terraform.tfstate"
  }
}

# Tagging Standards
locals {
  common_tags = {
    Environment     = var.environment
    Application     = "cATO-Command-Center"
    Owner          = var.resource_owner
    CostCenter     = var.cost_center
    DataClass      = var.data_classification
    ComplianceReq  = "FedRAMP-High"
    LastModified   = formatdate("YYYY-MM-DD", timestamp())
    LastModifiedBy = var.deployment_user
  }
}
```

**Azure Bicep** (Azure-specific resources):
```bicep
// Bicep Configuration Standards
targetScope = 'resourceGroup'

@description('Environment name (dev, staging, prod)')
@allowed(['dev', 'staging', 'prod'])
param environment string

@description('Application name')
param applicationName string = 'cato-command-center'

@description('Resource tags for compliance and management')
param tags object = {
  Environment: environment
  Application: applicationName
  Owner: 'Platform-Engineering'
  DataClassification: 'CUI'
  ComplianceFramework: 'FedRAMP-High'
  LastDeployed: utcNow('yyyy-MM-dd')
